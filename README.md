ðŸ‘‹ I'm an Application Security Analyst with over 15 years of experience spanning IT/OT systems, software development, and communications infrastructure. I specialize in improving the security posture and operational efficiency of complex legacy applications through application hardening, automated security tooling, and CI/CD integrations.

After three years in software engineering, I transitioned into cybersecurity â€” a space that perfectly blends my passion for security with those of problem-solving, software, and leadership. I bring a strong foundation in technical auditing, secure design, and pipeline automation.

ðŸ’¡ Iâ€™m continuously learning through ISC2, IEEE, and EC-Council content. Iâ€™m especially motivated by work that removes friction for engineers while elevating organizational security.

ðŸ“š Outside of work, I enjoy board games, personal finance, CAD and 3D printing, reading (technical and philosophical), and spending quality time with my family.


- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently enrolled in the Cyber Operations and Resilience (CORe) program at Boise State University.
